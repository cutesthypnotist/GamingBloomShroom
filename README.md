RGB outline effect shaders for Unity and VRChat. AudioLink and no AudioLink versions.

Please note that the effect will appear differently in the Unity Editor and VRChat. In order to get the correct effect, you will need to set your game view resolution to 1920x1080 for non-VR or to the appropriate resolution for your VR headset, i.e.: 3664x1920 for Quest 2, to see the correct effect.
